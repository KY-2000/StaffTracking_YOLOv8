# StaffTracking_YOLOv8
Small Project for Technical Interview, learn to use Google Colab and YOLOv8 to detect and track objects in real-time

## Dataset
The dataset came from "sample.mp4". To get every frame from the video, "create_image_dataset.py" is used to extract all frames.  

To detect the staff, I manually select frames with staff. I use Roboflow to annotate location of staff. Data augmentation techniques are applied too.
